WiFind is a framework for data collection of Wi-Fi networks and their signal strengths:<br />
• Currently collecting Wi-Fi data in NYC low-income housing projects <br />
• Analyzing data collected with other geo-located datasets to detect patterns and assess Wi-Fi accessibility<br />
• Researching open Wi-Fi networks and their effectiveness in closing the "digital divide"<br />
• Working on identifying potential clients and/or collaborators in need of wi-fi data<br />
